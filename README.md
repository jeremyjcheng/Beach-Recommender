# beach_recommender
This project is a Beach Recommender Application that allows users to get recommendations for nearby beaches based on their current location and surfing skill level. The application fetches real-time and historical weather data, including wave heights, wind speeds, and other surf-related conditions. It uses ARIMA forecasting models to provide weather and wave predictions for multiple beaches and ranks them according to the userâ€™s surfing ability level.
